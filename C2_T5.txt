You'll work with a chart from the previous tutorial. Run the next cell to load the data.

add Codeadd Markdown
# Path of the file to read
spotify_filepath = "../input/spotify.csv"
​
# Read the file into a variable spotify_data
spotify_data = pd.read_csv(spotify_filepath, index_col="Date", parse_dates=True)

Try out seaborn styles
Run the command below to try out the "dark" theme.

add Codeadd Markdown
# Change the style of the figure
sns.set_style("dark")
​
# Line chart 
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.lineplot(data=spotify_data)
​
# Mark the exercise complete after the code cell is run
step_1.check()
Correct:

Now, try out different themes by amending the first line of code and running the code cell again. Remember the list of available themes:

"darkgrid"
"whitegrid"
"dark"
"white"
"ticks"
This notebook is your playground -- feel free to experiment as little or as much you wish here! The exercise is marked as complete after you run every code cell in the notebook at least once.
